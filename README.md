*A Life Encyclopedia — The Gist of Everything.*

CoolCharts is a free, visual encyclopedia of life — a knowledge map of the world built from emoji-enhanced charts and Google Sheets embeds.  
It bridges **Wikipedia**, **ChatGPT**, and **WikiHow** by showing clear, structured overviews instead of long unstructured pages.
